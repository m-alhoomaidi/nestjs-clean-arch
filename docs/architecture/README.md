# Architecture Documentation

This section describes the overall architecture of our NestJS application, following Clean Architecture principles.

## Clean Architecture Overview

Our application follows Clean Architecture principles, separating concerns into distinct layers:

1. **Domain Layer** - Core business logic and entities
2. **Application Layer** - Use cases and application services
3. **Infrastructure Layer** - External concerns (database, external services)
4. **Interface Layer** - Controllers and DTOs
